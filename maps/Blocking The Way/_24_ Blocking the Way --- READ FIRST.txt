 notes for map # 24 (small - Blocking the Way)

 - THIS MAP HAS BEEN UPDATED - NOVEMBER 2004 - 
   for use with the Conquest game program 3.0 and newer.

 - This is one of the first maps I've created for the 'small screen' Conquest player.
 - There are 3 special marked boxes on this map,  each of them are connected to 
   each other (a.k.a. worm-hole effect)

 
 - If you enjoy these types of maps,  please drop Me a note and let Me know - thanks!
 - Do you enjoy these 'SMALL' type maps ?  Would you like more this size ?
   
  Your input is appreciated : )
